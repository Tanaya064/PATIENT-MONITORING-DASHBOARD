Project Overview

This project is a real-time patient monitoring dashboard designed as a case study for a Philips R&D internship. It simulates the continuous monitoring of patient vitals such as Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and SpOâ‚‚, detects abnormalities, and visualizes them dynamically on an interactive dashboard.
The system demonstrates Model-Based System Engineering, System Integration, and Automation

Key Features
Real-Time Data Simulation: Generates continuous patient vital readings every second.
Alert System: Automatically detects abnormal vitals using threshold-based logic.
Interactive Dashboard: Displays live charts and alert classifications.
Multi-Patient Monitoring: Tracks multiple patients simultaneously.
Deployment-Ready: Runs in Google Colab with Dash and Plotly.
